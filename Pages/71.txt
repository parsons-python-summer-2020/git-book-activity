You are good when you strive to give of yourself.
Yet you are not evil when you seek to gain for yourself.
For when you strive for gain you are but a root 
that clings to the earth and sucks from her breast.
Surely the fruit cannot say to the root, 
"Be like me, ripe and full and ever giving of your abundance."

For to the fruit giving is a need,
as receiving is a need to the root.

The Prophet, Kahlil Gibran
